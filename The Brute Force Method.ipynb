For example, you may want to find a production plan that will minimize costs, or you may want to find an investment plan that will maximize your returns. Actually, virtually every interesting problem in industry (and, why not, in life!) can be cast as an optimization problem. Some of these problems can be modeled and solved by current technology, and this is what we will see in this course.\n","\n","## Brute-force search\n","\n","We will see in this notebook some examples of optimization problems and how to solve them in a \"direct\" way. As you will see, there is a very simple way to solve most optimization problems; however, most simple approaches are either too inefficient or just too slow.

The Brute-force search is an exact approach if all your variables have discrete domains. However, in practice, some people try to come up with \"smart ideas\" to solve a problem. Those smart ideas can be divided in three main categories:\n","\n","* Exact combinatorial algorithms: Algorithms that give you the exact answer quickly, without checking all the possible combinations. In practice, there are very few real-world problems that admit exact combinatorial algorithms, but still, some of them exist, and they are extremely important. Note that we do not believe that there is always a smart combinatorial algorithm for all problems. In particular:\n","  * For some problems, we know that there are smart exact algorithms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity))\n","  * For others, like the so-called NP-complete problems, we do not believe that there are smart algorithms capable of solving them exactly: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness\n","\n","* Approximation algorithms: Similarly to combinatorial algorithms, approximation algorithms are usually efficient, but they do not necessarily give you an optimal solution. However, approximation algorithms typically come with guarantees, i.e., you will know that your solution is not more than 20% worse than the optimal. In pratice, approximation algorithms are very desirable, specially if you are dealing with a problem for which we do not expect to find an exact combinatorial algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm).\n","\n","* Heuristics: Class of algorithms that try to find a good solution for the problem, but do not give guarantees that this is actually going to happen. That doesn't sound exciting, but the truth is that the world is being guided by heuristics, and in some cases there is actually no way out. In most cases, the \"smart\" ideas people have when solving a problem are heuristics. In practice, the different between an optimal and a sub-optimal solution may not be super relevant (if your solution is within 0.001\\% of the optimal, it can be good enough), but knowing that your solution may not be optimal and communicating that to your boss or client is important (i.e., in terms of intellectual honesty and  reputation). There are many heuristics out there (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)).  \n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#\n","#if 4*c+6*d+2*t>1850\n","\n","#if15*x+24*d+18*t>best sol:\n","#"],"metadata":{"id":"_VHLR2HhJlA6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695607466087,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":295,"user":{"displayName":"Luis Pazmino","userId":"14732956196929376290"}},"outputId":"49cfca11-0305-4320-8f27-67a3d1cc14b4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["time: 454 µs (started: 2023-09-25 02:04:25 +00:00)\n"]}]}]}
