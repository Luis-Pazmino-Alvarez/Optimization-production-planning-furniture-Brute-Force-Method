# Optimization-production-planning-furniture-Brute-Force-Method
This project introduces optimization through brute-force search, using simple examples to demonstrate how to find feasible solutions that optimize specific criteria. It is ideal for understanding the fundamentals of solving production and planning problems when other methods are unavailable or unnecessary.
