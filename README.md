# Brute-Force-Method-Planning-Furniture-Production

This project presents a hands-on implementation of a **brute-force search algorithm in Python** to solve a classical **production planning optimization problem**. Inspired by real-world manufacturing challenges, the model evaluates all feasible combinations to determine the optimal product mix, subject to delivery deadlines and capacity constraints across fabrication, assembly, and shipping departments.

## Problem Overview

Veerman Furniture Company must decide the optimal number of chairs, desks, and tables to produce, based on:

* **Resource constraints** in hours available per department
* **Demand limits** per product
* **Profit margins** per unit

The objective is to **maximize total profit** while respecting all capacity and demand constraints.

## Key Features

* ✅ **Full problem modeling**: clear definition of inputs, decision variables, constraints, and objective
* ✅ **Manual brute-force implementation**: no external solver used
* ✅ **Nested loops** simulate the exhaustive search across all combinations
* ✅ **Performance measurement** using `ipython-autotime`
* ✅ **Educational commentary** to support learning and readability

## Technologies Used

* Python (vanilla)
* Jupyter Notebook
* `ipython-autotime` for runtime diagnostics

## Target Audience

* Recruiters seeking candidates with strong modeling logic and optimization intuition
* Learners exploring foundational operations research and brute-force heuristics
* Professionals seeking an illustrative example of constrained resource allocation

## Sample Output

The notebook prints feasible solutions where:

* Labor constraints are not violated
* Demand limits are respected
* Profit is calculated and optimal mix is derived
